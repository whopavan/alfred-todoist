### More about Natural language date time
Basic natural language date time like "...tomorrow at 8 am", "...next monday", "...every week", "...next weekend" should be identified. Though easy to break if you intend to (its a simple regex looking for texts like "tomorrow", week days name, am, pm etc).

`Natural language date time is not perfect but will update as much as I can to make it better.`<br>
